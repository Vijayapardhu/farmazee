# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AttributeError: property 'solution_count' of 'FarmerProblem' object has no setter

**Problem**: Django was trying to set the `solution_count` property during query annotations, but it was a read-only property.

**Solution**: 
- Added a setter method to the `solution_count` property in `farmer_problems/models.py`
- Changed the annotation in `farmer_problems/views.py` from `solution_count=Count('solutions')` to `solutions_count=Count('solutions')`
- Updated the template to use `solutions_count` instead of `solution_count`

**Files Modified**:
- `farmer_problems/models.py` - Added property setter
- `farmer_problems/views.py` - Changed annotation field name
- `farmer_problems/templates/farmer_problems/problem_list.html` - Updated template reference

### 2. FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'query' into field

**Problem**: Admin panel was trying to use 'query' field but the actual field name was 'query_text'.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `admin_panel/views.py` to use `query_text` instead of `query` in the `values()` and `annotate()` calls

**Files Modified**:
- `admin_panel/views.py` - Fixed field reference in popular queries analytics

### 3. SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal

**Problem**: The `weather/advanced_weather_service.py` file had duplicate content causing syntax errors.

**Solution**: 
- Removed all duplicate content from the file
- Kept only the clean, original implementation
- File now properly ends at line 631

**Files Modified**:
- `weather/advanced_weather_service.py` - Removed duplicate content

### 4. IndentationError: unexpected indent in weather/views.py

**Problem**: The `weather/views.py` file had duplicate/orphaned code at the end causing indentation errors.

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate code from lines 190-197
- File now properly ends at line 188

**Files Modified**:
- `weather/views.py` - Removed duplicate content

## Testing

All fixes have been tested and the Django server now starts without errors. The following URLs should now work:

- `/problems/` - Farmer problems list page
- `/admin-panel/` - Admin panel dashboard
- All weather-related pages using the advanced weather service

## Status

✅ All errors resolved
✅ Server starts successfully
✅ No linting errors
✅ Ready for testing
